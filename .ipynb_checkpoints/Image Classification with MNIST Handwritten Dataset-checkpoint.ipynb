    "In this section we will do the \"Hello World\" of deep learning: training a deep learning model to correctly classify hand-written digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    " * Understand how deep learning can solve problems traditional programming methods cannot\n",
    " * Learn about the [MNSIT handwritten digits dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)\n",
    " * Use the [Keras API](https://keras.io/) to load the MNIST dataset and prepare it for training\n",
    " * Create a simple neural network to perform image classification\n",
    " * Train the neural network using the prepped MNIST dataset\n",
    " * Observe the performance of the trained neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem: Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional programming, the programmer is able to articulate rules and conditions in their code that their program can then use to act in the correct way. This approach continues to work exceptionally well for a huge variety of problems.\n",
    " \n",
    "Image classification, which asks a program to correctly classify an image it has never seen before into its correct class, is near impossible to solve with traditional programming techniques. How could a programmer possibly define the rules and conditions to correctly classify a huge variety of images, especially taking into account images that they have never seen?\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution: Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning excels at pattern recognition by trial and error. By training a deep neural network with sufficient data, and providing the network with feedback on its performance via training, the network can identify, though a huge amount of iteration, its own set of conditions by which it can act in the correct way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The MNIST Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In the history of deep learning, the accurate image classification of the [MNSIT dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, was a major development. While today the problem is considered trivial, doing image classification with MNIST has become a kind of \"Hello World\" for deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training and Validation Data and Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with images for deep learning, we need both the images themselves, usually denoted as `X`, and also, correct [labels](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#label) for these images, usually denoted as `Y`. Furthermore, we need `X` and `Y` values both for *training* the model, and then, a separate set of `X` and `Y` values for *validating* the performance of the model after it has been trained. Therefore, we need 4 segments of data for the MNIST dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `x_train`: Images used for training the neural network\n",
    "2. `y_train`: Correct labels for the `x_train` images, used to evaluate the model's predictions during training\n",
    "3. `x_valid`: Images set aside for validating the performance of the model after it has been trained\n",
    "4. `y_valid`: Correct labels for the `x_valid` images, used to evaluate the model's predictions after it has been trained\n",
    " \n",
    "The process of preparing data for analysis is called [Data Engineering](https://medium.com/@rchang/a-beginners-guide-to-data-engineering-part-i-4227c5c457d7). To learn more about the differences between training data and validation data (as well as test data), check out [this article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-test-validation-datasets/) by Jason Brownlee.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the Data Into Memory (with Keras)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many [deep learning frameworks](https://developer.nvidia.com/deep-learning-frameworks), each with their own merits. In this workshop we will be working with [Tensorflow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner), and specifically with the [Keras API](https://keras.io/). Keras has many useful built in functions designed for the computer vision tasks. It is also a legitimate choice for deep learning in a professional setting due to its [readability](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/readable-code/) and efficiency, though it is not alone in this regard, and it is worth investigating a variety of frameworks when beginning a deep learning project.\n",
    " \n",
    "One of the many helpful features that Keras provides are modules containing many helper methods for [many common datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets), including MNIST."
